*Deploying war file created from maven to tomcat
=>First installation of tomcat :
1. wget tomcat 8 zip file from tomcat official site
2. Move the zip file to the working directory of jenkins
3. Unzip the file 
4. Go to apache-tomcat folder and then conf file
5. Edit the file server.xml by changing the Connector Port to 8090
Note:
-> Open the same port in VM by changing inbound rules
-> If you are running the project in master server itself then port need to change because on 8080 port jenkins is listening and by default tomact also listen with same port.
6. Go to bin folder of apache-tomcat and change the permission to executable by chmod +x *
7. Go to conf folder of apache-tomcat and edit the tomcat-users.xml by
  <role rolename="manager-script"/>
  <role rolename="admin-gui"/>
  <user username="tomcat" password="tomcat" roles="manager-script,admin-gui"/>
  <user username="jenkin" password="jenkin" roles="manager-script"/>
 
  create the role, user (either tomcat or jenkin) and remove the comment across the role.
8. Go to bin folder and run ./startup.sh to start the tomcat 
9. Now go to the browser and pig to the link ip:8080 or ip:8090 to get tomcat page.
